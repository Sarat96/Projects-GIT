					•	The early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honoured.

In 2016, Hopper posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her contributions.
					•	"Known as 'Amazing Grace' and 'the first lady of software,' "Hopper's work helped make coding languages more practical and accessible, and she created the first compiler, which translates source code from one language into another." 
					•	She also made a new programming language that was "a widely used framework for coding languages at the time," the Navy said. That language was called FLOW-MATIC, and is a basis of the widely used Common Business Operating Language (COBOL).

			      	•	The winner of the 2008 ACM A.M. Turing Award and also the first U.S. woman to be awarded a Ph.D. from a computer science department (in 1968 from Stanford University).
					•	Liskov’s most significant impact stems from her influential contributions to the use of data abstraction, a valuable method for organizing complex program. Liskov designed the CLU programming language, an object-oriented language incorporating “clusters” to provide coherent, systematic handling of abstract data types, which are comprised of a set of data and the set of operations that can be performed on the data. 
					•	Her most recent research focuses on techniques that enable a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. Her insights have helped build robust, fault-tolerant distributed systems that are resistant to errors and hacking.
					•	The author of numerous publications, she wrote three books, including Abstraction and Specification in Program Development with John Guttag, which has educated generations of students in how to write good software.
